# Dog-vs-Cat-Image-Classification-using-CNN
A deep learning project using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify images as either dogs or cats. Built using TensorFlow and Keras, the model leverages data augmentation, image preprocessing, and real-time training with ImageDataGenerator. Achieves strong binary classification performance on image data.
